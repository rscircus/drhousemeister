# Dr. House Meister

This bunch of scripts **organize/sort/refile the files in your current
folder** by their extension into newly created folders named as follows:

* _archives - *most common ones*
* _documents - *linux, win*
* _images - *most common ones*
* _pdfs - *including skim<sup>1</sup> notes*
* _presentations - *linux, win, mac*
* _tables - *linux, win*

It was created to clean up my *Downloads* folder from time to time.

## Genesis Note

This started out in bash while scratching my own itch. However, I
switched to python as things became way to complicated in bash and the
program has already twice the functionality with half the lines of code
in its initial state.
