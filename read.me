# Dr. House Meister

This bunch of scripts organize/sort/refile the files in your current folder
by their extension into newly created folders named as follows:

* _documents
* _images
* _pdfs
* _tables

It was created to clean up my *Downloads* folder from time to time.


## Changelog

### [0.1] - 2015.06.14
#### Created
- filesort.py - refile files as described in read.me


## Genesis Note

This started out in bash. However, I switched to python as things became way to
complicated in bash and the program has already twice the functionality with
half the lines of code in it's initial state.
